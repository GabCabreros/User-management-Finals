# Troubleshooting White Screen Issues in Angular on Render

If you're experiencing a white screen when accessing your deployed Angular application on Render, follow these troubleshooting steps:

## Step 1: Check the Browser Console for Errors

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect")
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Look for any error messages that might indicate what's wrong

Common errors include:
- 404 errors for JavaScript files
- CORS issues
- JavaScript runtime errors

## Step 2: Verify Your Deployment Configuration

1. Make sure your Render static site is configured correctly:
   - **Build Command**: `chmod +x render-build.sh && ./render-build.sh`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist/user-management-system`

2. Check that the redirect/rewrite rules are set up:
   - Go to your static site in the Render dashboard
   - Click on "Settings" > "Redirect/Rewrite Rules"
   - Ensure you have a rule: Source `/*`, Destination `/index.html`, Action `Rewrite`

## Step 3: Try Manual Fixes

If the issue persists, try these manual fixes:

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**:
   - This can resolve issues with cached outdated files

2. **Try a different browser**:
   - Sometimes browser-specific issues can cause white screens

3. **Access specific routes directly**:
   - Try accessing your application with a specific route appended to the URL
   - Example: `https://your-app.onrender.com/login`

4. **Check if the base URL is accessible**:
   - Try accessing just the root URL: `https://your-app.onrender.com`

## Step 4: Redeploy with Debug Information

1. Add console logs to your main component:

```typescript
// In your main app component
ngOnInit() {
  console.log('Application initialized');
  // Add more detailed logs
}
```

2. Update your index.html to show a message before the app loads:

```html
<body>
  <div id="pre-bootstrap">
    Application is loading...
  </div>
  <app>Loading...</app>
  
  <script>
    console.log('Index.html loaded');
  </script>
</body>
```

3. Push these changes and redeploy

## Step 5: Check for Build Issues

1. Look at the build logs in your Render dashboard:
   - Go to your static site
   - Click on "Logs" tab
   - Check for any warnings or errors during the build process

2. Common build issues include:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Angular configuration errors
   - Environment variable issues

## Step 6: Contact Render Support

If all else fails, you may need to contact Render support:
1. Provide them with your site URL
2. Share the build logs
3. Describe the steps you've taken to troubleshoot

## Additional Tips for Angular Deployments

1. **Use hash-based routing**:
   - Update your Angular routing to use hash-based routing, which can be more reliable on static hosts
   - In your app-routing.module.ts:
   ```typescript
   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true })],
     exports: [RouterModule]
   })
   ```

2. **Ensure all assets use relative paths**:
   - Check that your assets (images, CSS, etc.) use relative paths instead of absolute paths

3. **Verify environment.prod.ts**:
   - Make sure your production environment variables are correctly set
